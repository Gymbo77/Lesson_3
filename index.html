				<h2>Slow, Deep and Hard [1991]</h2>
				<img src="img/slowdeep.jpg" alt="first">
				<p class="text">
					Slow, Deep and Hard is the debut studio album by the American gothic metal band Type O Negative, released
					in
					1991 on Roadrunner Records. The album, originally titled None More Negative and released in 1990 under
					the
					group's former name Repulsion, launched the band's career. Slow, Deep and Hard is a darkly humorous,
					semi-autobiographical album with tracks 1, 3, 4 and 7 based on a failed relationship of vocalist/bass
					guitarist Peter Steele
				</p>
				<p>
					According to guitarist Kenny Hickey, Steele based the main riff of Gravitational Constant: G = 6.67 ×
					10−8 cm−3 gm−1 sec−2 (later known as "Gravity") from the theme song of the 1964 American sitcom The
					Munsters.
				</p>
				<p>
					Roadrunner Records released a remastered version of Slow, Deep and Hard on March 24, 2009.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the 30th anniversary of Slow, Deep and Hard, Roadrunner Records, in conjunction with Run Out Groove,
					reissued the debut on vinyl.

				<h2>Bloody Kisses [1993]</h2>
				<img src="img/bks.jpg" alt="second">
				<p class="text">
					Bloody Kisses is the third studio album by the American gothic metal band Type O Negative and the last
					recording with their original lineup as drummer Sal Abruscato left in late 1993. The album includes one
					of their best known songs, "Black No. 1", which earned the band a considerable cult following
				</p>
				<p>The album further established recurring motifs of the band's music, such as including cover songs
					recorded in the gothic metal style, sample-heavy soundscapes in between songs, and lyrics replete with
					dry, satirical humor.
				</p>
				<p>Bloody Kisses is notable for being the first album released on Roadrunner Records to achieve gold
					certification.
				</p>

			<div id="album3" class="text-album3">
				<h2>October Rust [1996]</h2>
				<img src="img/octoberrust.jpg" alt="third">
				<p class="text">
					October Rust is the fourth studio album by Type O Negative. It was released in 1996.[5] This is the first
					album with Johnny Kelly credited as the band's drummer, although programmed drums are used on the album.
					October Rust has more ballads and less of the doom metal sound of previous or subsequent albums. It also
					features a very heavy cover of Neil Young's "Cinnamon Girl".

				It is the first of the band's albums with a "joke intro"; in this case, "Bad Ground", which is 38 seconds of
				low-level buzzing, meant to sound as if one or more audio leads is incorrectly plugged into the input jacks
				of an amplifier.

				<h2>World Coming Down [1999]</h2>
				<img src="img/WorldComingDown.jpg" alt="fourth">
				<p class="text">
					World Coming Down is the fifth studio album by the American gothic metal band Type O Negative. It is
					considered to be the darkest of the band's releases,having been written after a series of deaths in
					frontman Peter Steele's family, combined with the desire to break away from the sexually charged themes
					of the previous albums.It was also the band's first album to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard 200.
				</p>

			<div id="album5" class="text-album5">
				<h2>Life is Killing Me [2003]</h2>
				<img src="img/lskm.jpg" alt="fifth">
				<p class="text">
					Life Is Killing Me is the sixth studio album by gothic metal band Type O Negative. It was released on
					June 17, 2003, and was their final studio album released through record label Roadrunner Records.
				</p>
				<p>
					The album's title and content refers primarily to frontman Peter Steele's dissatisfied life outlook and
					experiences with mental illness at the time of writing and production, with lyrics concerning
					relationship problems and the illness and death of his parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					The album reached No. 39 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 27,000 copies in its first week, and
					received positive reviews from music critics, who noted a more melodic sound in comparison to previous
					records. "I Don't Wanna Be Me" was released as a promotional single, for which a music video was
					produced.
				</p>

				<h2>Dead Again [2006]</h2>
				<img src="img/Dead_again.jpg" alt="sixth">
				<p class="text">
					Dead Again (stylized as DЭДD ДGДIИ) is the seventh and final studio album by the American gothic metal
					band Type O Negative, released before the death of frontman Peter Steele in 2010, and subsequent
					dissolution of the band. It was released on March 13, 2007, through record label Steamhammer, a
					subsidiary of SPV.
				</p>
				<h3>Production</h3>
				<p>
					The band uses studio drums instead of a drum machine for the first time since their third album, Bloody
					Kisses. Thus, it remains the only Type O Negative studio album with Johnny Kelly's actual playing, as he
					was only "credited" as the drummer on the three albums prior to Dead Again.[3]
